Hola!, qué bueno verte por acá... escribe y déjame un saludo ;)
The path a rocket or guided missile takes during powered flight is directly influenced by its attitude, that is its orientation in space. During the atmospheric portion of flight, fins may deflect to steer a missile. Outside the atmosphere, changing the direction of thrust by articulating exhaust nozzles or changing the rocket's attitude influences its flight path. Thus the term guidance and control has become associated with attitude control during the powered ascent phase of a spacecraft's mission. After a few minutes' launch, though, a spacecraft may face a mission of many years in freefall, during which its attitude has no relation to guidance except during short, infrequent propulsive maneuvers.
